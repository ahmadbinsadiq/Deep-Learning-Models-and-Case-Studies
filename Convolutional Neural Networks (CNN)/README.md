# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Project

## Overview
This repository provides implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for various image-related tasks. The goal is to demonstrate the application of CNNs in different domains, including image classification. Each implementation is provided with detailed documentation and example usage.

## CNN Implementations

### 1. MNIST Digit Classification
- **File:** `cnn_mnist_classification.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a CNN for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

### 2. General Image Classification
- **File:** `cnn_image_classification.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook showcases the use of CNNs for general image classification tasks. It includes preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation on various image datasets.

## Repository Structure
