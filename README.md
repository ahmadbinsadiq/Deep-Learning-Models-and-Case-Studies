# Deep Learning Models and Case Studies

## Overview

Welcome to the Deep Learning Models and Case Studies repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of various deep learning models and their applications, complete with detailed case studies. Our goal is to provide a valuable resource for students, researchers, and professionals looking to explore and understand the practical implementation of different machine learning techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Models**: Contains different types of deep learning models.
  - **CNN**: Convolutional Neural Networks
  - **RNN**: Recurrent Neural Networks
  - **DNN**: Deep Neural Networks
  - **GAN**: Generative Adversarial Networks
  - **Transfer Learning**: Models leveraging pre-trained networks

- **Case Studies**: Real-world applications and analyses using the models.
  - **MNIST Classification**: Handwritten digit classification using CNNs
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Text sentiment classification using RNNs
  - **Image Generation**: Creating images using GANs
  - **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicting future values using LSTMs
  - **Custom Projects**: User-specific projects and analyses

## Getting Started
