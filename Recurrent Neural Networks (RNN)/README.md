# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Project

## Overview
This repository provides implementations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for various sequence-related tasks. The goal is to demonstrate the application of RNNs in different domains, including sentiment analysis, time series forecasting, and sequence prediction. Each implementation is provided with detailed documentation and example usage.

## RNN Implementations

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
- **File:** `rnn_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook demonstrates the implementation of an RNN for performing sentiment analysis on text data. It includes preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation using a sentiment dataset.

### 2. Time Series Forecasting
- **File:** `rnn_time_series_forecasting.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook showcases the use of RNNs for time series forecasting tasks. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation on a financial or weather-related time series dataset.

### 3. Sequence Prediction
- **File:** `rnn_sequence_prediction.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook demonstrates the use of RNNs for predicting sequences, such as text generation or next-step prediction in sequential data.
